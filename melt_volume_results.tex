\section*{Integrated Snow Melt Volumes}

This document summarizes the total snow melt volumes obtained from the energy balance model applied over the Mont-Blanc area during the first week of May 2025. Two surface conditions are compared: fresh snow and polluted snow with reduced albedo.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Total melted volume (fresh snow): \SI{43969930.99}{\cubic\meter}
  \item Total melted volume (polluted snow): \SI{67889143.48}{\cubic\meter}
  \item Additional melt due to pollution: \SI{23919212.49}{\cubic\meter}
\end{itemize}

The excess melt caused by snow pollution corresponds to \textbf{9567.68 Olympic-size swimming pools}, assuming a reference volume of \SI{2500}{\cubic\meter} per pool.

Overall, the total snow melt is \textbf{54.40\% higher} under polluted snow conditions compared to fresh snow.
